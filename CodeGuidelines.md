Coding Guidelines
=================

Naming Conventions
------------------
 - We will use underscore to separate two words in a 
   variable, function, and class (snake_case).
 - We will use camelCase to name our python files.

Indent Style Conventions
------------------------
 - We will use tabs to indent.

Comment Conventions
-------------------
 - Short comments and inline comments should use hashtags.
 - Long comments should use docstring.
 - Ending quotation marks (""") should be on a different 
   line on docstrings.
 - Space after # for comments.  
 - Only comment on hard functions.
   
Commas and Operators Conventions
--------------------------------
 - We will use spaces between operators and commas.

Line Length Conventions
-----------------------
 - Maximum line length will be 100 characters.

String Conventions
------------------
 - We will use double quotation marks for strings.
 - Joining two strings should use string concatenation 
   (“string” + “string”), joining multiple or long 
   strings should use string interpolation (formatting).
   
Import Conventions
------------------
 - All imports will be at the top of the file.
 - Imports will be on separate lines unless they are 
   from the same library.
   
Miscellaneous
-------------
 - Provide high-level summary of modules/classes, 
   author, and date of creation.
 - Functions should have two empty preceding lines 
   to improve readability.
