FDM
===

### Program
The program is a gamified version of the FDM website. It allows users to register for 
an account; once logged in, users can access the games page, where they are presented 
with games to choose from and the leaderboard.

### Running the program
To run the program, simply run `app.py` and you will be presented with a link to the
website.

### Program structure
The program consists of multiple files, the main one being `app.py`. This file 
calls functions from other modules as well as references HTML templates in the 
`Templates` folder. This folder in turn references items from the `static` folder, 
where images and CSS files are contained.

### Database
The provided MariaBD database was used in the project.  
The program is set up using the localhost in the program, as there were issues with
the remote host.  
To connect to the database, simply use the login details and SSH using the 
Local port `3307`. This port is used in the code and thus can not be different.
