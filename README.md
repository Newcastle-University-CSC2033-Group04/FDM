Overview 
The current pandemic has put more of a focus on the digital profile of FDM to attract current students and graduates to apply to its’ Graduate Programme.  Work is being done to update the student and graduate webpages to make them more interactive and engaging.

Gamification 
Gamification is the application of typical game features to other areas of activity. This could include point scoring, competition with others and having rules of play. Usually activities or processes are gamified in order to retain and engage employees, increase their loyalty to the business and encourages engagement with the material they are using. Gamification can be used across various industries as well as different departments including learning and development, recruitment, marketing and sales.
